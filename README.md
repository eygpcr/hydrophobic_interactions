# hydrophobic_interactions
Many methods and tools are available to determine interactions between ligand and receptor such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions. This code can be used to identify residues that contribute to hydrophobic interactions between ligand and receptor and to determine interaction occupancy throughout the simulation.
